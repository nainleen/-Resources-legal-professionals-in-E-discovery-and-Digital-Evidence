#  Resources legal professionals in E discovery and Digital Evidence

Welcome to Resources legal professionals in E discovery and Digital Evidence.

If you are a total e-discovery novice or an experienced practitioner, we hope this guide will provide you with a lot of useful information that you can apply to your day-to-day professional life.

# Introduction to e-Discovery
I will describes and defines electronic discovery, or “e-discovery,” for anyone involved in the processes of litigation or investigations. It should provide an introduction and overview of the basic concepts and terms you will need to begin any conversation around the practice of electronic discovery. Following will dive into more nuanced and specific issues within the process of managing electronic evidence in litigation.

# What is Electronic Discovery (E-Discovery  e-discovery)?

Electronic discovery is a procedure by which parties involved in a legal case preserve, collect, review, and exchange information in electronic formats for the purpose of using it as evidence in the case. 

There are many different types of electronic formats - or electronically stored information (ESI), as it is known in the e-discovery world - that may be sought in e-discovery, ranging from common data sources, such as basic email and Microsoft Word documents, to more arcane ones like files from a company-specific database. One thing to note, if you hadn't already, is the "e" in e-discovery standards for electronic. 

# How does E-Discovery Work?

Because we have an entire section devoted to the various e-discovery stages . One thing to know right off the bat is that e-discovery is not a single action – like taking a deposition or filing a motion - rather - e-discovery is a process comprised of many linked actions that starts from the time a lawsuit is reasonably foreseeable all the way until documents are presented in court. 

The e-discovery process is set in motion as soon as the litigation is reasonably foreseeable, which triggers the legal duty to preserve potentially relevant ESI. Attorneys from both sides determine the scope of e-discovery, identify and preserve (lockdown) the relevant ESI, and make e-discovery requests and challenges. Once parameters are set, ESI is then collected, analyzed, and formatted for use in court. Don't let this simplified description fool you. E-Discovery is a dynamic, complex process that challenges even the most experienced legal and technical minds. 

# The rules you need to know

### Rule 26(f): Setting the Ground Rules

The actual negotiation will begin with what is known as a 26(f) Conference, which happens before any discovery can occur. The courts have made it clear these conferences should happen as early as possible and parties should agree on foundational principles like the forms of production. If parties can't agree within two weeks, they face the judge for what is known as the Rule 16 Conference. Once an actual discovery request is issued, the responding party may object, under Rule 26(c) and 37(a).

### Rule 26(g): A Reasonable Inquiry

The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure mandates a standard of care, including “that to the best of the person's knowledge, information, and belief formed after a reasonable inquiry: with respect to a disclosure, [the response] is complete and correct as of the time it is made.” However, “reasonable” is a matter for the court to decide on the totality of the circumstances.

If parties fail to cooperate and judges or magistrate judges become involved, parties lose much of their freedom to negotiate. Also note Rule 26(b)(3), which says discovery of opposing counsel's work- product is admissible only upon showing the party seeking it has substantial need and is unable to obtain equivalent materials by other means.

### FRCP Rule 26(d)(2): There's More Than One Way to Do eDiscovery

Don't let opposing counsel or judges impose a set pattern on the process. Just because one approach has worked for them in the past, doesn't mean it's always the right way to proceed. In addition, don't let the other party's timeline get in the way of what you need to do. The rules clearly state that, “methods of discovery may be used in any sequence,“ and “discovery by one party does not require any other party to delay its discovery.”

### Rule 34(b): Get Data How You Want It Rule 34(b) 
Allows the requesting party to decide how it wants information to be produced and lets the responding party object if impractical. Note that if the requesting party fails to specify the form for producing data, the producing party has the option to either produce the information in a form in which it is ordinarily maintained, or in an electronically search-able form. Courts have rebuked parties that produce data in printed or other non-native formats. (When in doubt, get the native format. It retains potentially useful metadata and is usually easier to access.)

### Rule 37: Still a Safe Harbor? Rule 37(f) 
Used to be known as the “safe harbor” provision. However, few legal teams used this provision. The amended Rule 37(e) allows sanctions for failure to preserve ESI, but limits sanctions for failure to preserve so that negligence, even gross negligence, will not be sufficient for imposition of most severe penalties. Under the amended rule, courts may only sanction parties if one party is found to have “intent to deprive another party” of information and if that information cannot be recovered or produced from another source. If electronically stored information that should have been preserved in the anticipation or conduct of litigation is lost because a party failed to take reasonable steps to preserve it, and it cannot be restored or replaced through additional discovery, the court may impose sanctions.

### Rule Rule 26(b)(1): Keep it in Proportion The old rule 26(b)(2)(C)(iii) 
Was clear that a court could limit discovery when the burden outweighed benefit. However, new Rule 26(b)(1), implemented by the December 1, 2015 amendments, takes the factors in these old requirements and puts them at the heart of any discussion about the scope of discovery.

# ERMD Model or Diagram

The EDRM consists of nine stages, which we will describe. The process begins with information governance, identification, preservation, and collection. The data management functions include processing, review, analysis, production, and presentation.

### EDRM Stages

Information Governance – Getting your electronic house in order to mitigate risk & expenses should e-discovery become an issue, from initial creation of ESI (electronically stored information) through its final disposition.

Identification – Locating potential sources of ESI & determining its scope, breadth & depth.

Preservation – Ensuring that ESI is protected against inappropriate alteration or destruction.

Collection – Gathering ESI for further use in the e-discovery process (processing, review, etc.).

Processing – Reducing the volume of ESI and converting it, if necessary, to forms more suitable for review & analysis.

Review – Evaluating ESI for relevance & privilege.

Analysis – Evaluating ESI for content & context, including key patterns, topics, people & discussion.

Production – Delivering ESI to others in appropriate forms & using appropriate delivery mechanisms.

Presentation – Displaying ESI before audiences (at depositions, hearings, trials, etc.), especially in native & near-native forms, to elicit further information, validate existing facts or positions, or persuade an audience.


# Digital Evidence

Digital evidence includes information on computers, audio files, video recordings, and digital images. This evidence is essential in computer and Internet crimes, but is also valuable for facial recognition, crime scene photos, and surveillance tapes.
1. Audio Evidence
2. Computer/Internet Crimes
3. Image Analysis
4. Video Analysis

# Introduction

Digital devices are everywhere in today’s world, helping people communicate locally and globally with ease. Most people immediately think of computers, cell phones and the Internet as the only sources for digital evidence, but any piece of technology that processes information can be used in a criminal way. For example, hand-held games can carry encoded messages between criminals and even newer household appliances, such as a refrigerator with a built-in TV, could be used to store, view and share illegal images. The important thing to know is that responders need to be able to recognize and properly seize potential digital evidence.

# Principles of Digital Evidence

Information that is stored electronically is said to be “digital” because it has been broken down into digits; binary units of ones (1) and zeros (0), that are saved and retrieved using a set of instructions called software or code. Any kind of information—photographs, words, spreadsheets—can be created and saved using these types of instructions. Finding and exploiting evidence saved in this way is a growing area of forensics and constantly changes as the technology evolves.

### Internet

The launch of the Internet or World Wide Web in the mid 1990s truly ushered in the “age of access.” For the first time, individuals outside the academic world could use it to connect with others (and their computers) in a brand new way. The Internet opened up access to a world of information and resources, but also provided a highway for the traffic of illegal images, information and espionage.

### Computers
In the late 1970s, employees at the Flagler Dog Track in Florida used a computer to create and print fraudulent winning tickets. This prompted Florida to enact the first computer crime law, the Florida Computer Crimes Act, which declared un-authorized use of computing facilities a crime. Federal laws followed in 1984. Computer crimes continue to be a growing problem in both the public and private sector. A single computer can contain evidence of criminal activity carried out on the web, or the criminal use can be contained in the computer itself, such as pornography, copyright infringement, extortion, counterfeiting and much more. Digital evidence is located on the computer’s hard drive and peripheral equipment, including removable media such as thumb drives and CD-ROM discs.

### Mobile devices
Although handheld voice transmission devices using radio transmission have been in use since the 1940s (the Walkie-Talkie), the first version of what we would now call a cell phone was not developed until the 1980s. Cell phone use around the world skyrocketed in the 1990s and hit 4.6 billion cell subscriptions by the end of 2009. Cell phone and wireless technology has expanded to include many types of mobile devices such as tablet computers and hand-held video games. Once used only for voice communications, today’s cell phones are also used to take digital photos and movies, send instant messages, browse the web and perform many of the same tasks as a computer. Mobile devices allow criminals to engage in an ever-growing variety of activities and the devices keep track of every move and message. It is this tracking capability that turns mobile devices into key evidence in many cases.

### ADAM Principles	
Building on the ACPO Guidelines with a more generic application outside of law enforcement, a doctoral thesis proposed the following overriding principles to be followed by digital forensic practitioners

1. The activities of the digital forensic practitioner should not alter the original data. If the requirements of the work mean that this is not possible then the effect of the practitioner’s actions on the original data should be clearly identified and the process that caused any changes justified.
2. A complete record of all activities associated with the acquisition and handling of the original data and any copies of the original data must be maintained. This includes compliance with the appropriate rules of evidence, such as maintaining a chain of custody record, and verification processes such as hashing.
3.The digital forensic practitioner must not undertake any activities which are beyond their ability or knowledge.
4. The digital forensic practitioner must take into consideration all aspects of personal and equipment safety whilst undertaking their work.
5. At all times the legal rights of anyone affected by your actions should be considered.
6. The practitioner must be aware of all organisational policies and procedures relating to their activities
7. Communication must be maintained as appropriate with the client, legal practitioners, supervisors and other team members

### Best evidence rule

Digital evidence is almost never in a format readable by humans, requiring additional steps to include digital documents as evidence (i.e. printing out the material). It has been argued that this change of format may mean digital evidence does not qualify under the "best evidence rule".However, the "Federal Rules of Evidence" rule 1001 states "if data are stored in a computer…, any printout or other output readable by sight, shown to reflect the data accurately, is an ‘original.’
